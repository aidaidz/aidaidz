- 👋 Hi, I’m @aidaidz
- 👀 I’m interested in the data science behind algorithms, AI recognition, and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, HTML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to better the general environment, or more specifically student life.
- Apart from the geeky stuff, I like to play chess, collect random data, tackle math problems, watch Chinese dramas, and play mobile games. I'm also interested in Astrology, MBTI, Enneagram, Big-5-personality, and tarot.
